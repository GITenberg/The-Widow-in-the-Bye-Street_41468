<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Down Bye Street, in a little Shropshire town,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>There lived a widow with her only son:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She had no wealth nor title to renown,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Nor any joyous hours, never one.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She rose from ragged mattress before sun</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And stitched all day until her eyes were red,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And had to stitch, because her man was dead.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Sometimes she fell asleep, she stitched so hard,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Letting the linen fall upon the floor;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And hungry cats would steal in from the yard,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And mangy chickens pecked about the door</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Craning their necks so ragged and so sore</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To search the room for bread-crumbs, or for mouse,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But they got nothing in the widow's house.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Mostly she made her bread by hemming shrouds</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For one rich undertaker in the High Street,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Who used to pray that folks might die in crowds</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And that their friends might pay to let them lie sweet;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And when one died the widow in the Bye Street</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Stitched night and day to give the worm his dole.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The dead were better dressed than that poor soul.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Her little son was all her life's delight,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For in his little features she could find</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A glimpse of that dead husband out of sight,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Where out of sight is never out of mind.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And so she stitched till she was nearly blind,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or till the tallow candle end was done,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To get a living for her little son.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Her love for him being such she would not rest,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It was a want which ate her out and in,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Another hunger in her withered breast</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Pressing her woman's bones against the skin.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To make him plump she starved her body thin.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And he, he ate the food, and never knew,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He laughed and played as little children do.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>When there was little sickness in the place</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She took what God would send, and what God sent</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Never brought any colour to her face</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Nor life into her footsteps when she went</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Going, she trembled always withered and bent</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For all went to her son, always the same,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He was first served whatever blessing came.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Sometimes she wandered out to gather sticks,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For it was bitter cold there when it snowed.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And she stole hay out of the farmer's ricks</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For bands to wrap her feet in while she sewed,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And when her feet were warm and the grate glowed</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She hugged her little son, her heart's desire,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>With 'Jimmy, ain't it snug beside the fire?'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So years went on till Jimmy was a lad</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And went to work as poor lads have to do,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And then the widow's loving heart was glad</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To know that all the pains she had gone through</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all the years of putting on the screw,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Down to the sharpest turn a mortal can,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Had borne their fruit, and made her child a man.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>He got a job at working on the line</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Tipping the earth down, trolly after truck,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>From daylight till the evening, wet or fine,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>With arms all red from wallowing in the muck,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And spitting, as the trolly tipped, for luck,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And singing 'Binger' as he swung the pick</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Because the red blood ran in him so quick.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So there was bacon then, at night, for supper</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In Bye Street there, where he and mother stay;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And boots they had, not leaky in the upper,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And room rent ready on the settling day;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And beer for poor old mother, worn and grey,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And fire in frost; and in the widow's eyes</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It seemed the Lord had made earth paradise.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>And there they sat of evenings after dark</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Singing their song of 'Binger,' he and she,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her poor old cackle made the mongrels bark</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And 'You sing Binger, mother,' carols he;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'By crimes, but that's a good song, that her be':</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And then they slept there in the room they shared,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all the time fate had his end prepared.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>One thing alone made life not perfect sweet:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The mother's daily fear of what would come</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>When woman and her lovely boy should meet,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>When the new wife would break up the old home.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Fear of that unborn evil struck her dumb,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And when her darling and a woman met,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She shook and prayed, 'Not her, O God; not yet.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Not yet, dear God, my Jimmy go from me.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Then she would subtly question with her son.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Not very handsome, I don't think her be?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'God help the man who marries such an one.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her red eyes peered to spy the mischief done.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She took great care to keep the girls away,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all her trouble made him easier prey.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>There was a woman out at Plaister's End,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Light of her body, fifty to the pound,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A copper coin for any man to spend,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Lovely to look on when the wits were drowned.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her husband's skeleton was never found,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It lay among the rocks at Glydyr Mor</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Where he drank poison finding her a whore.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She was not native there, for she belonged</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Out Milford way, or Swansea; no one knew.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She had the piteous look of someone wronged,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna,' her name, a widow, last of Triw.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She had lived at Plaister's End a year or two;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>At Callow's cottage, renting half an acre;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She was a hen-wife and a perfume-maker.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Secret she was; she lived in reputation;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But secret unseen threads went floating out:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her smile, her voice, her face, were all temptation,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>All subtle flies to trouble man the trout;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Man to entice, entrap, entangle, flout...</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To take and spoil, and then to cast aside:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Gain without giving was the craft she plied.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>And she complained, poor lonely widowed soul,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>How no one cared, and men were rutters all;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>While true love is an ever-burning goal</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Burning the brighter as the shadows fall.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all love's dogs went hunting at the call,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Married or not she took them by the brain,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Sucked at their hearts and tossed them back again.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Like the straw fires lit on Saint John's Eve,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She burned and dwindled in her fickle heart;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For if she wept when Harry took his leave,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her tears were lures to beckon Bob to start.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And if, while loving Bob, a tinker's cart</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Came by, she opened window with a smile</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And gave the tinker hints to wait a while.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She passed for pure; but, years before, in Wales,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Living at Mountain Ash with different men,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her less discretion had inspired tales</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Of certain things she did, and how, and when.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Those seven years of youth; we are frantic then.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She had been frantic in her years of youth,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The tales were not more evil than the truth.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She had two children as the fruits of trade</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Though she drank bitter herbs to kill the curse,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Both of them sons, and one she overlaid,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The other one the parish had to nurse.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Now she grew plump with money in her purse,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Passing for pure a hundred miles, I guess,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>From where her little son wore workhouse dress.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>There with the Union boys he came and went,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A parish bastard fed on bread and tea,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Wearing a bright tin badge in furthest Gwent,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And no one knowing who his folk could be.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>His mother never knew his new name: she,--</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She touched the lust of those who served her turn,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And chief among her men was Shepherd Ern.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>A moody, treacherous man of bawdy mind,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Married to that mild girl from Ercall Hill,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Whose gentle goodness made him more inclined</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To hotter sauces sharper on the bill.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The new lust gives the lecher the new thrill,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The new wine scratches as it slips the throat,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The new flag is so bright by the old boat.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Ern was her man to buy her bread and meat,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Half of his weekly wage was hers to spend,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She used to mock 'How is your wife, my sweet?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or wail, 'O, Ernie, how is this to end?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or coo, 'My Ernie is without a friend,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She cannot understand my precious life,'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Ernie would go home and beat his wife.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So the four souls are ranged, the chess-board set,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The dark, invisible hand of secret Fate</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Brought it to come to being that they met</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>After so many years of lying in wait.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>While we least think it he prepares his Mate.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Mate, and the King's pawn played, it never ceases</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Though all the earth is dust of taken pieces.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>October Fair-time is the time for fun,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For all the street is hurdled into rows</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Of pens of heifers blinking at the sun,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Lemster sheep which pant and seem to doze,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And stalls of hardbake and galanty shows,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And cheapjacks smashing crocks, and trumpets blowing,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And the loud organ of the horses going.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>There you can buy blue ribbons for your girl</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or take her in a swing-boat tossing high,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or hold her fast when all the horses whirl</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Round to the steam pipe whanging at the sky,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or stand her cockshies at the cocoa-shy,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Or Queen Victoria done in gingerbread.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Then there are rifle shots at tossing balls,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'And if you hit you get a good cigar.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And strength-whackers for lads to lamm with mauls,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Cheshire cheeses on a greasy spar.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The country folk flock in from near and far,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Women and men, like blow-flies to the roast,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>All love the fair; but Anna loved it most.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Anna was all agog to see the fair;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She made Ern promise to be there to meet her,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To arm her round to all the pleasures there,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And buy her ribbons for her neck, and treat her,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So that no woman at the fair should beat her</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In having pleasure at a man's expense.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She planned to meet him at the chapel fence.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So Ernie went; and Jimmy took his mother,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Dressed in her finest with a Monmouth shawl,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And there was such a crowd she thought she'd smother,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And O, she loved a pep'mint above all.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Clash go the crockeries where the cheapjacks bawl,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Baa go the sheep, thud goes the waxwork's drum,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Ernie cursed for Anna hadn't come.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>He hunted for her up and down the place,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Raging and snapping like a working brew.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'If you're with someone else I'll smash his face,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And when I've done for him I'll go for you.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He bought no fairings as he'd vowed to do</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For his poor little children back at home</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Stuck at the glass 'to see till father come.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Not finding her, he went into an inn,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Busy with ringing till and scratching matches.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Where thirsty drovers mingled stout with gin</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And three or four Welsh herds were singing catches.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The swing-doors clattered, letting in in snatches</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The noises of the fair, now low, now loud.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Ern called for beer and glowered at the crowd.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>While he was glowering at his drinking there</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In came the gipsy Bessie, hawking toys;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A bold-eyed strapping harlot with black hair,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>One of the tribe which camped at Shepherd's Bois.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She lured him out of inn into the noise</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Of the steam-organ where the horses spun,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And so the end of all things was begun.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Newness in lust, always the old in love.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Put up your toys,' he said, 'and come along,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>We'll have a turn of swing-boats up above,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And see the murder when they strike the gong.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Don't 'ee,' she giggled.  'My, but ain't you strong.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And where's your proper girl?  You don't know me.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I do.'  'You don't.'  'Why, then, I will,' said he.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Anna was late because the cart which drove her</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Called for her late (the horse had broke a trace),</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She was all dressed and scented for her lover,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her bright blue blouse had imitation lace,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The paint was red as roses on her face,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She hummed a song, because she thought to see</span></div>

</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>When she arrived and found her Ernie gone,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Promising faithful, too, and then to miss.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O, Ernie, won't I give it you for this.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And looking up she saw a couple cling,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Ern with his arm round Bessie in the swing.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Ern caught her eye and spat, and cut her dead,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Bessie laughed hardly, in the gipsy way.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Anna, though blind with fury, tossed her head,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Biting her lips until the red was grey,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For bitter moments given, bitter pay,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The time for payment comes, early or late,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>No earthly debtor but accounts to Fate.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She turned aside, telling with bitter oaths</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>What Ern should suffer if he turned agen,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And there was Jimmy stripping off his clothes</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Within a little ring of farming men.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Now, Jimmy, put the old tup into pen.'</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Then the ram butted and the game began,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>The good old wrestling game of Ram and Man,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>At which none knows the hunter from the hunted.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Then there was clap of hands and Jimmy grinned</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Or else he'd take all comers at the Whackers.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And some made rude remarks of rams and knackers,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And mother shook to get her son alone,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So's to be sure he hadn't broke a bone.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>None but the lucky man deserves the fair,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Anne, with her raddled cheeks and Sunday dress,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Smiled upon Jimmy, seeing him succeed,</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>All the great things of life are swiftly done,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Creation, death, and love the double gate.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>We have to hurry at the touch of Fate;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>When Life knocks at the door no one can wait,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>When Death makes his arrest we have to go.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And so with love, and Jimmy found it so.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Love, the sharp spear, went pricking to the bone,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In that one look, desire and bitter aching,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Longing to have that woman all alone</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For her dear beauty's sake all else forsaking;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And sudden agony that set him shaking</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Lest she, whose beauty made his heart's blood cruddle,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Should be another man's to kiss and cuddle.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She was beside him when he left the ring,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her soft dress brushed against him as he passed her;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He thought her penny scent a sweeter thing</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Than precious ointment out of alabaster;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Love, the mild servant, makes a drunken master.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She smiled, half sadly, out of thoughtful eyes,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all the strong young man was easy prize.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She spoke, to take him, seeing him a sheep,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'How beautiful you wrastled with the ram,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It made me all go tremble just to peep,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I am that fond of wrastling, that I am.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Why, here's your mother, too.  Good-evening, ma'am.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Old mother blinked, while Jimmy hardly knew</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Joy of her beauty ran in him so hot,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Old trembling mother by him was forgot,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>While Anna searched the mother's face, to know</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Whether she took her for a whore or no.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>The woman's maxim, 'Win the woman first,'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Made her be gracious to the withered thing.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'This being in crowds do give one such a thirst,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Come, ma'am, a cup of tea would do you good;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>There's nothing like a nice hot cup of tea</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So off they set, with Anna talking to her,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>How nice the tea would be after the crowd,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And mother thinking half the time she knew her,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Jimmy's heart's blood ticking quick and loud,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Death beside him knitting at his shroud,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all the High Street babbling with the fair,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And white October clouds in the blue air.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So tea was made, and down they sat to drink;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O the pale beauty sitting at the board!</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>There is more death in women than we think,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>There is much danger in the soul adored,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The white hands bring the poison and the cord;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Death has a lodge in lips as red as cherries,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Death has a mansion in the yew-tree berries.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>They sat there talking after tea was done,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Jimmy blushed at Anna's sparkling looks,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Anna flattered mother on her son,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Catching both fishes on her subtle hooks.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>With twilight, tea and talk in ingle-nooks,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And music coming up from the dim street,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Mother had never known a fair so sweet.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Now cow-bells clink, for milking-time is come,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The drovers stack the hurdles into carts,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>New masters drive the straying cattle home,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Many a young calf from his mother parts,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Hogs straggle back to sty by fits and starts;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The farmers take a last glass at the inns,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And now the frolic of the fair begins.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>All of the side shows of the fair are lighted,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Flares and bright lights, and brassy cymbals clanging,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Beginning now' and 'Everyone's invited,'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Shatter the pauses of the organ's whanging,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The Oldest Show on Earth and the Last Hanging,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'The Murder in the Red Barn,' with real blood,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The rifles crack, the Sally shy-sticks thud.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Anna walked slowly homewards with her prey,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Holding old tottering mother's weight upon her,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And pouring in sweet poison on the way</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Of 'Such a pleasure, ma'am, and such an honour,'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And 'One's so safe with such a son to con her</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Through all the noises and through all the press,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Boys daredn't squirt tormenters on her dress.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>At mother's door they stop to say 'Good-night.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And mother must go in to set the table.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Anna pretended that she felt a fright</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To go alone through all the merry babel:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'My friends are waiting at "The Cain and Abel,"</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Just down the other side of Market Square,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It'd be a mercy if you'd set me there.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So Jimmy came, while mother went inside;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Anna has got her victim in her clutch.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy, all blushing, glad to be her guide,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Thrilled by her scent, and trembling at her touch.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She was all white and dark, and said not much;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She sighed, to hint that pleasure's grave was dug,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And smiled within to see him such a mug.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>They passed the doctor's house among the trees,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She sighed so deep that Jimmy asked her why.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I'm too unhappy upon nights like these,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>When everyone has happiness but I!'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Then, aren't you happy?'  She appeared to cry,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Blinked with her eyes, and turned away her head:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Not much; but some men understand,' she said.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Her voice caught lightly on a broken note,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy half-dared but dared not touch her hand,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Yet all his blood went pumping in his throat</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Beside the beauty he could understand,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Death stopped knitting at the muffling band.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'The shroud is done,' he muttered, 'toe to chin.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He snapped the ends, and tucked his needles in.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy, half stammering, choked, 'Has any man----'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He stopped, she shook her head to answer 'No.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Then tell me.'  'No.  P'raps some day, if I can.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It hurts to talk of some things ever so.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But you're so different.  There, come, we must go</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>None but unhappy women know how good</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It is to meet a soul who's understood.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'No.  Wait a moment.  May I call you Anna?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Perhaps.  There must be nearness 'twixt us two.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Love in her face hung out his bloody banner,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all love's clanging trumpets shocked and blew.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'When we got up to-day we never knew.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I'm sure I didn't think, nor you did.'  'Never.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'And now this friendship's come to us for ever.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Now, Anna, take my arm, dear.'  'Not to-night,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That must come later when we know our minds,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>We must agree to keep this evening white,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>We'll eat the fruit to-night and save the rinds.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all the folk whose shadows darked the blinds,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all the dancers whirling in the fair,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Were wretched worms to Jim and Anna there.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'How wonderful life is,' said Anna, lowly.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'But it begins again with you for friend.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In the dim lamplight Jimmy thought her holy,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A lovely fragile thing for him to tend,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Grace beyond measure, beauty without end.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna,' he said; 'Good-night.  This is the door.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I never knew what people meant before.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Good-night, my friend.  Good-bye.'  'But, O my sweet,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The night's quite early yet, don't say good-bye,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Come just another short turn down the street,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The whole life's bubbling up for you and I.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Somehow I feel to-morrow we may die.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Come just as far as to the blacksmith's light.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But 'No' said Anna; 'Not to-night.  Good-night.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>All the tides triumph when the white moon fills.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Down in the race the toppling waters shout,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The breakers shake the bases of the hills,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>There is a thundering where the streams go out,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And the wise shipman puts his ship about</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Seeing the gathering of those waters wan,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But what when love makes high tide in a man?</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy walked home with all his mind on fire,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>One lovely face for ever set in flame.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He shivered as he went, like tautened wire,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Surge after surge of shuddering in him came</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And then swept out repeating one sweet name,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna, O Anna,' to the evening star.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Anna was sipping whiskey in the bar.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So back to home and mother Jimmy wandered,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Thinking of Plaister's End and Anna's lips.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He ate no supper worth the name, but pondered</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>On Plaister's End hedge, scarlet with ripe hips,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And of the lovely moon there in eclipse,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And how she must be shining in the house</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Behind the hedge of those old dog-rose boughs.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Old mother cleared away.  The clock struck eight.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Why, boy, you've left your bacon, lawks a me,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So that's what comes of having tea so late,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Another time you'll go without your tea.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Your father liked his cup, too, didn't he,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Always "another cup" he used to say,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He never went without on any day.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>How nice the lady was and how she talked,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I've never had a nicer fair, not ever.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'She said she'd like to see us if we walked</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To Plaister's End, beyond by Watersever.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Nice-looking woman, too, and that, and clever;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>We might go round one evening, p'raps, we two;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or I might go, if it's too far for you.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'No,' said the mother, 'we're not folk for that;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Meet at the fair and that, and there an end.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Rake out the fire and put out the cat,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>These fairs are sinful, tempting folk to spend.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Of course she spoke polite and like a friend;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Of course she had to do, and so I let her,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But now it's done and past, so I forget her.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'I don't see why forget her.  Why forget her?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She treat us kind.  She weren't like everyone.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I never saw a woman I liked better,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And he's not easy pleased, my father's son.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So I'll go round some night when work is done.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Now, Jim, my dear, trust mother, there's a dear.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Well, so I do, but sometimes you're so queer.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She blinked at him out of her withered eyes</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Below her lashless eyelids red and bleared.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her months of sacrifice had won the prize,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her Jim had come to what she always feared.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And yet she doubted, so she shook and peered</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And begged her God not let a woman take</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The lovely son whom she had starved to make.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Doubting, she stood the dishes in the rack,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'We'll ask her in some evening, then,' she said,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'How nice her hair looked in the bit of black.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And still she peered from eyes all dim and red</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To note at once if Jimmy drooped his head,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or if his ears blushed when he heard her praised,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Jimmy blushed and hung his head and gazed.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'This is the end,' she thought.  'This is the end.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'll have to sew again for Mr Jones,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Do hems when I can hardly see to mend,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And have the old ache in my marrow-bones.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And when his wife's in child-bed, when she groans,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She'll send for me until the pains have ceased,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And give me leavings at the christening feast.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>And sit aslant to eye me as I eat,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>"You're only wanted here, ma'am, for to-day,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Just for the christ'ning party, for the treat,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Don't ever think I mean to let you stay;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Two's company, three's none, that's what I say."</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Life can be bitter to the very bone</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>When one is poor, and woman, and alone.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Jimmy,' she said, still doubting, 'Come, my dear,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Let's have our "Binger," 'fore we go to bed,'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And then 'The parson's dog,' she cackled clear,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Lep over stile,' she sang, nodding her head.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'His name was little Binger.'  'Jim,' she said,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Binger, now, chorus' ... Jimmy kicked the hob,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The sacrament of song died in a sob.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy went out into the night to think</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Under the moon so steady in the blue.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The woman's beauty ran in him like drink,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The fear that men had loved her burnt him through;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The fear that even then another knew</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>All the deep mystery which women make</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To hide the inner nothing made him shake.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna, I love you, and I always shall.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He looked towards Plaister's End beyond Cot Hills.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A white star glimmered in the long canal,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A droning from the music came in thrills.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Love is a flame to burn out human wills,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Love is a flame to set the will on fire,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Love is a flame to cheat men into mire.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>One of the three, we make Love what we choose,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But Jimmy did not know, he only thought</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That Anna was too beautiful to lose,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That she was all the world and he was naught,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That it was sweet, though bitter, to be caught.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna, I love you.'  Underneath the moon,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I shall go mad unless I see you soon.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>The fair's lights threw aloft a misty glow.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The organ whangs, the giddy horses reel,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The rifles cease, the folk begin to go,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The hands unclamp the swing-boats from the wheel,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>There is a smell of trodden orange peel;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The organ drones and dies, the horses stop,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And then the tent collapses from the top.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>The fair is over, let the people troop,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The drunkards stagger homewards down the gutters,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The showmen heave in an excited group,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The poles tilt slowly down, the canvas flutters,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The mauls knock out the pins, the last flare sputters.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Lower away.'  'Go easy.'  'Lower, lower.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'You've dang near knock my skull in.  Loose it slower.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Back in the horses.'  'Are the swing-boats loaded?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'All right to start.'  'Bill, where's the cushion gone?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The red one for the Queen?'  'I think I stowed it.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'You think, you think.  Lord, where's that cushion, John?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'It's in that bloody box you're sitting on,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>What more d'you want?'  A concertina plays</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Far off as wandering lovers go their ways.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Up the dim Bye Street to the market-place</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The dead bones of the fair are borne in carts,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Horses and swing-boats at a funeral pace</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>After triumphant hours quickening hearts;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A policeman eyes each waggon as it starts,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The drowsy showmen stumble half asleep,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>One of them catcalls, having drunken deep.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So out, over the pass, into the plain,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And the dawn finds them filling empty cans</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In some sweet-smelling dusty country lane,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Where a brook chatters over rusty pans.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The iron chimneys of the caravans</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Smoke as they go.  And now the fair has gone</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To find a new pitch somewhere further on.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>But as the fair moved out two lovers came,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Ernie and Bessie loitering out together;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Bessie with wild eyes, hungry as a flame,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Ern like a stallion tugging at a tether.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It was calm moonlight, and October weather,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So still, so lovely, as they topped the ridge.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>They brushed by Jimmy standing on the bridge.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>And, as they passed, they gravely eyed each other,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And the blood burned in each heart beating there;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And out into the Bye Street tottered mother,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Without her shawl, in the October air.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Jimmy,' she cried, 'Jimmy.'  And Bessie's hair</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Drooped on the instant over Ernie's face,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And the two lovers clung in an embrace.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'O, Ern.'  'My own, my Bessie.'  As they kissed</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy was envious of the thing unknown.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So this was Love, the something he had missed,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Woman and man athirst, aflame, alone.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Envy went knocking at his marrow-bone,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Anna's face swam up so dim, so fair,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Shining and sweet, with poppies in her hair.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">
</div>
<p class="center pfirst"><span class="large">III</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>After the fair, the gang began again.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Tipping the trollies down the banks of earth.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The truck of stone clanks on the endless chain,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A clever pony guides it to its berth.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Let go.'  It tips, the navvies shout for mirth</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To see the pony step aside, so wise,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But Jimmy sighed, thinking of Anna's eyes.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>And when he stopped his shovelling he looked</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Over the junipers towards Plaister way,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The beauty of his darling had him hooked,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He had no heart for wrastling with the clay.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'O Lord Almighty, I must get away;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O Lord, I must.  I must just see my flower,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Why, I could run there in the dinner hour.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>The whistle on the pilot engine blew,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The men knocked off, and Jimmy slipped aside</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Over the fence, over the bridge, and through,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And then ahead along the water-side,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Under the red-brick rail-bridge, arching wide,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Over the hedge, across the fields, and on;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The foreman asked: 'Where's Jimmy Gurney gone?'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>It is a mile and more to Plaister's End,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But Jimmy ran the short way by the stream,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And there was Anna's cottage at the bend,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>With blue smoke on the chimney, faint as steam.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'God, she's at home,' and up his heart a gleam</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Leapt like a rocket on November nights,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And shattered slowly in a burst of lights.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Anna was singing at her kitchen fire,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She was surprised, and not well pleased to see</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A sweating navvy, red with heat and mire,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Come to her door, whoever he might be.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But when she saw that it was Jimmy, she</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Smiled at his eyes upon her, full of pain,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And thought, 'But, still, he mustn't come again.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>People will talk; boys are such crazy things;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But he's a dear boy though he is so green.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So, hurriedly, she slipped her apron strings,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And dabbed her hair, and wiped her fingers clean,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And came to greet him languid as a queen,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Looking as sweet, as fair, as pure, as sad,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>As when she drove her loving husband mad.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Poor boy,' she said, 'Poor boy, how hot you are.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She laid a cool hand to his sweating face.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'How kind to come.  Have you been running far?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'm just going out; come up the road a pace.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O dear, these hens; they're all about the place.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So Jimmy shooed the hens at her command,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And got outside the gate as she had planned.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna, my dear, I love you; love you, true;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I had to come--I don't know--I can't rest--</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I lay awake all night, thinking of you.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Many must love you, but I love you best.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Many have loved me, yes, dear,' she confessed,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She smiled upon him with a tender pride,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'But my love ended when my husband died.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Still, we'll be friends, dear friends, dear, tender friends;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Love with its fever's at an end for me.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Be by me gently now the fever ends,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Life is a lovelier thing than lovers see,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'd like to trust a man, Jimmy,' said she,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'May I trust you?'  'Oh, Anna dear, my dear----</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Don't come so close,' she said, 'with people near.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Dear, don't be vexed; it's very sweet to find</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>One who will understand; but life is life,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And those who do not know are so unkind.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But you'll be by me, Jimmy, in the strife,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I love you though I cannot be your wife;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And now be off, before the whistle goes,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or else you'll lose your quarter, goodness knows.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'When can I see you, Anna?  Tell me, dear.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To-night?  To-morrow?  Shall I come to-night?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Jimmy, my friend, I cannot have you here;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But when I come to town perhaps we might.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Dear, you must go; no kissing; you can write,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And I'll arrange a meeting when I learn</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>What friends are doing' (meaning Shepherd Ern).</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Good-bye, my own.'  'Dear Jim, you understand.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>If we were only free, dear, free to meet,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Dear, I would take you by your big, strong hand</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And kiss your dear boy eyes so blue and sweet;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But my dead husband lies under the sheet,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Dead in my heart, dear, lovely, lonely one,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So, Jim, my dear, my loving days are done.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>But though my heart is buried in his grave</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Something might be--friendship and utter trust--</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And you, my dear starved little Jim shall have</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Flowers of friendship from my dead heart's dust;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Life would be sweet if men would never lust.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Why do you, Jimmy?  Tell me sometime, dear,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Why men are always what we women fear.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Not now.  Good-bye; we understand, we two,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And life, O Jim, how glorious life is;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>This sunshine in my heart is due to you;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I was so sad, and life has given this.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I think "I wish I had something of his,"</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Do give me something, will you be so kind?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Something to keep you always in my mind.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'I will,' he said.  'Now go, or you'll be late.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He broke from her and ran, and never dreamt</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That as she stood to watch him from the gate</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her heart was half amusement, half contempt,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Comparing Jim the squab, red and unkempt,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In sweaty corduroys, with Shepherd Ern.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She blew him kisses till he passed the turn.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>The whistle blew before he reached the line;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The foreman asked him what the hell he meant,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Whether a duke had asked him out to dine,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Or if he thought the bag would pay his rent?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Jim was fined before the foreman went.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But still his spirit glowed from Anna's words,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Cooed in the voice so like a singing bird's.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'O Anna, darling, you shall have a present;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'd give you golden gems if I were rich,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And everything that's sweet and all that's pleasant.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He dropped his pick as though he had a stitch,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And stared tow'rds Plaister's End, past Bushe's Pitch.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O beauty, what I have to give I'll give,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>All mine is yours, beloved, while I live.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>All through the afternoon his pick was slacking,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>His eyes were always turning west and south,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The foreman was inclined to send him packing,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But put it down to after fair-day drouth;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He looked at Jimmy with an ugly mouth,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Jimmy slacked, and muttered in a moan,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'My love, my beautiful, my very own.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So she had loved.  Another man had had her;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She had been his with passion in the night;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>An agony of envy made him sadder,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Yet stabbed a pang of bitter-sweet delight--</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O he would keep his image of her white.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The foreman cursed, stepped up, and asked him flat</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>What kind of gum-tree he was gaping at.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>It was Jim's custom, when the pay day came,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To take his weekly five and twenty shilling</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Back in the little packet to his dame;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Not taking out a farthing for a filling,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Nor twopence for a pot, for he was willing</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That she should have it all to save or spend.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But love makes many lovely customs end.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Next pay day came and Jimmy took the money,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But not to mother, for he meant to buy</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A thirteen-shilling locket for his honey,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Whatever bellies hungered and went dry,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A silver heart-shape with a ruby eye.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He bought the thing and paid the shopman's price,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And hurried off to make the sacrifice.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Is it for me?  You dear, dear generous boy.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>How sweet of you.  I'll wear it in my dress.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>When you're beside me life is such a joy,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>You bring the sun to solitariness.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She brushed his jacket with a light caress,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>His arms went round her fast, she yielded meek;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He had the happiness to kiss her cheek.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'My dear, my dear.'  'My very dear, my Jim,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>How very kind my Jimmy is to me;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I ache to think that some are harsh to him;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Not like my Jimmy, beautiful and free.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>My darling boy, how lovely it would be</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>If all would trust as we two trust each other.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Jimmy's heart grew hard against his mother.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She, poor old soul, was waiting in the gloom</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For Jimmy's pay, that she could do the shopping.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The clock ticked out a solemn tale of doom;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Clogs on the bricks outside went clippa-clopping,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The owls were coming out and dew was dropping.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The bacon burnt, and Jimmy not yet home.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The clock was ticking dooms out like a gnome.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'What can have kept him that he doesn't come?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O God, they'd tell me if he'd come to hurt.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The unknown, unseen evil struck her numb,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She saw his body bloody in the dirt,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She saw the life blood pumping through the shirt,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She saw him tipsy in the navvies' booth,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She saw all forms of evil but the truth.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>At last she hurried up the line to ask</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>If Jim were hurt or why he wasn't back.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She found the watchman wearing through his task;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Over the fire basket in his shack;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Behind, the new embankment rose up black.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Gurney?' he said.  'He'd got to see a friend.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Where?'  'I dunno.  I think out Plaister's End.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Thanking the man, she tottered down the hill,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The long-feared fang had bitten to the bone.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The brook beside her talked as water will</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That it was lonely singing all alone,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The night was lonely with the water's tone,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And she was lonely to the very marrow.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Love puts such bitter poison on Fate's arrow.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She went the long way to them by the mills,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She told herself that she must find her son.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The night was ominous of many ills;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The soughing larch-clump almost made her run,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her boots hurt (she had got a stone in one)</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And bitter beaks were tearing at her liver</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That her boy's heart was turned from her forever.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She kept the lane, past Spindle's, past the Callows',</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her lips still muttering prayers against the worst,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And there were people coming from the sallows,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Along the wild duck patch by Beggar's Hurst.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Being in moonlight mother saw them first,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She saw them moving in the moonlight dim,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A woman with a sweet voice saying 'Jim.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Trembling she grovelled down into the ditch,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>They wandered past her pressing side to side.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'O Anna, my belov'd, if I were rich.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It was her son, and Anna's voice replied,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Dear boy, dear beauty boy, my love and pride.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And he: 'It's but a silver thing, but I</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Will earn you better lockets by and bye.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Dear boy, you mustn't.'  'But I mean to do.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'What was that funny sort of noise I heard?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Where?'  'In the hedge; a sort of sob or coo.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Listen.  It's gone.'  'It may have been a bird.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Jim tossed a stone but mother never stirred.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She hugged the hedgerow, choking down her pain,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>While the hot tears were blinding in her brain.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>The two passed on, the withered woman rose,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>For many minutes she could only shake,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Staring ahead with trembling little 'Oh's,'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The noise a very frightened child might make.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'O God, dear God, don't let the woman take</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>My little son, God, not my little Jim.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O God, I'll have to starve if I lose him.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>So back she trembled, nodding with her head,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Laughing and trembling in the bursts of tears,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her ditch-filled boots both squelching in the tread,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her shopping-bonnet sagging to her ears,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her heart too dumb with brokenness for fears.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The nightmare whickering with the laugh of death</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Could not have added terror to her breath.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She reached the house, and: 'I'm all right,' said she,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I'll just take off my things; but I'm all right,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I'd be all right with just a cup of tea,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>If I could only get this grate to light,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The paper's damp and Jimmy's late to-night;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>"Belov'd, if I was rich," was what he said,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O Jim, I wish that God would kill me dead.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>While she was blinking at the unlit grate,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Scratching the moistened match-heads off the wood,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She heard Jim coming, so she reached his plate,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And forked the over-frizzled scraps of food.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'You're late,' she said, 'and this yer isn't good,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>He saw the narrow grave under the wall,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Stirring no limb, but crying through the night.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He slept, convinced that he was Anna's knight.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Money for mother crying herself blind.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>'Why not a man like him?' she said, 'What next?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>By this they'd reached her cottage in the dim,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Among the daisies that the cold had kexed.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Because I say.  Now, Anna, don't be vexed.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I'm more than vexed,' she said, 'with words like these.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>"You say," indeed.  How dare you.  Leave me, please.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna, my Anna.'  'Leave me.'  She was cold,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Proud and imperious with a lifting lip,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Blazing within, but outwardly controlled;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He had a colt's first instant of the whip.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The long lash curled to cut a second strip.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'You to presume to teach.  Of course, I know</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>You're mother's Sunday scholar, aren't you?  Go.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She slammed the door behind her, clutching skirts.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna.'  He heard her bedroom latches thud.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He learned at last how bitterly love hurts;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He longed to cut her throat and see her blood,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To stamp her blinking eyeballs into mud.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Anna, by God!'  Love's many torments make</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That tune soon change to 'Dear, for Jesus' sake.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>He beat the door for her.  She never stirred,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>But primming bitter lips before her glass;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Admired her hat as though she hadn't heard,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And tried her front hair parted, and in mass.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She heard her lover's hasty footsteps pass.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'He's gone,' she thought.  She crouched below the pane,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And heard him cursing as he tramped the lane.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Rage ran in Jimmy as he tramped the night;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Rage, strongly mingled with a youth's disgust</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>At finding a beloved woman light,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all her precious beauty dirty dust;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A tinsel-varnish gilded over lust.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Nothing but that.  He sat him down to rage,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Beside the stream whose waters never age.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Plashing, it slithered down the tiny fall</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To eddy wrinkles in the trembling pool</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>With that light voice whose music cannot pall,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Always the note of solace, flute-like, cool.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And when hot-headed man has been a fool,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He could not do a wiser thing than go</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To that dim pool where purple teazles grow.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>He glowered there until suspicion came,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Suspicion, anger's bastard, with mean tongue,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To mutter to him till his heart was flame,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And every fibre of his soul was wrung,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>That even then Ern and his Anna clung</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Mouth against mouth in passionate embrace.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>There was no peace for Jimmy in the place.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Raging he hurried back to learn the truth.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The little swinging wicket glimmered white,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The chimney jagged the skyline like a tooth,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Bells came in swoons for it was Sunday night.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The garden was all dark, but there was light</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Up in the little room where Anna slept:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The hot blood beat his brain; he crept, he crept.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Clutching himself to hear, clutching to know,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Along the path, rustling with withered leaves,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Up to the apple, too decayed to blow,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Which crooked a palsied finger at the eaves.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And up the lichened trunk his body heaves.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Dust blinded him, twigs snapped, the branches shook,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He leaned along a mossy bough to look.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Nothing at first, except a guttering candle</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Shaking amazing shadows on the ceiling,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Then Anna's voice upon a bar of 'Randal,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Where have you been:' and voice and music reeling,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Trembling, as though she sang with flooding feeling.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The singing stopped midway upon the stair,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Then Anna showed in white with loosened hair.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Her back was towards him, and she stood awhile,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Like a wild creature tossing back her mane,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And then her head went back, he saw a smile</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>On the half face half turned towards the pane;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her eyes closed, and her arms went out again.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Jim gritted teeth, and called upon his Maker,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She drooped into a man's arms there to take her.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Agony first, sharp, sudden, like a knife,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Then down the tree to batter at the door;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Open there.  Let me in.  I'll have your life.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>You Jezebel of hell, you painted whore,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Talk about faith, I'll give you faith galore.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The window creaked, a jug of water came</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Over his head and neck with certain aim.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Clear out,' said Ern; 'I'm here, not you, to-night,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Clear out.  We whip young puppies when they yap.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'If you're a man,' said Jim, 'Come down and fight,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'll put a stopper on your ugly chap.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Go home,' said Ern; 'Go home and get your pap.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>To kennel, pup, and bid your mother bake</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Some soothing syrup in your puppy cake.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>There was a dibble sticking in the bed,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Jim wrenched it out and swung it swiftly round,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And sent it flying at the shepherd's head:</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I'll give you puppy-cake.  Take that, you hound.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The broken glass went clinking to the ground,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The dibble balanced, checked, and followed flat.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'My God,' said Ern, 'I'll give you hell for that.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>He flung the door ajar with 'Now, my pup--</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Hold up the candle, Anna--now, we'll see.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'By crimes, come on,' said Jimmy; 'Put them up.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Come, put them up, you coward, here I be.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Jim, eleven stone, what chance had he</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Against fourteen? but what he could he did;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Ern swung his right: 'That settles you, my kid.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy went down and out: 'The kid,' said Ern.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'A kid, a sucking puppy; hold the light.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And Anna smiled: 'It gave me such a turn,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>You look so splendid, Ernie, when you fight.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She looked at Jim with: 'Ern, is he all right?'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'He's coming to.'  She shuddered, 'Pah, the brute.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>What things he said'; she stirred him with her foot.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'You go inside,' said Ern, 'and bolt the door,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'll deal with him.'  She went and Jimmy stood.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Now, pup,' said Ern, 'don't come round here no more.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'm here, not you, let that be understood.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I tell you frankly, pup, for your own good.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Give me my hat,' said Jim.  He passed the gate,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And as he tottered off he called, 'You wait.'</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>'Thanks, I don't have to,' Shepherd Ern replied;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'You'll do whatever waiting's being done.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The door closed gently as he went inside,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The bolts jarred in the channels one by one.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'I'll give you throwing bats about, my son.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Anna.'  'My dear?'  'Where are you?'  'Come and find.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The light went out, the windows stared out blind.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Blind as blind eyes forever seeing dark.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And in the dim the lovers went upstairs,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her eyes fast closed, the shepherd's burning stark,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>His lips entangled in her straying hairs,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Breath coming short as in a convert's prayers,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Her stealthy face all drowsy in the dim</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And full of shudders as she yearned to him.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Jim crossed the water, cursing in his tears,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'By cripes, you wait.  My God, he's with her now</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all her hair pulled down over her ears;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Loving the blaggard like a filthy sow,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I saw her kiss him from the apple bough.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>They say a whore is always full of wiles,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O God, how sweet her eyes are when she smiles.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Curse her and curse her.  No, my God, she's sweet,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It's all a helly nightmare.  I shall wake.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>If it were all a dream I'd kiss her feet,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I wish it were a dream for Jesus' sake.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>One thing: I bet I made his guzzle ache,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I cop it fair before he sent me down,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'll cop him yet some evening on the crown.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>O God, O God, what pretty ways she had,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He's kissing all her skin, so white and soft.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She's kissing back.  I think I'm going mad.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Like rutting rattens in the apple loft.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She held that light she carried high aloft</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Full in my eyes for him to hit me by,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I had the light all dazzling in my eye.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>She had her dress all clutched up to her shoulder,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all her naked arm was all one gleam.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It's going to freeze to-night, it's turning colder,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I wish there was more water in the stream,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'd drownd myself.  Perhaps it's all a dream,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And bye and bye I'll wake and find it stuff;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>By crimes, the pain I suffer's real enough.'</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>About two hundred yards from Gunder Loss</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He stopped to shudder, leaning on the gate,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He bit the touchwood underneath the moss;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Rotten, like her,' he muttered in his hate;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He spat it out again with 'But, you wait,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>We'll see again, before to-morrow's past,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>In this life he laughs longest who laughs last.'</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>All through the night the stream ran to the sea,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The different water always saying the same,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Cat-like, and then a tinkle, never glee,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>A lonely little child alone in shame.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>An otter snapped a thorn twig when he came,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It drifted down, it passed the Hazel Mill,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>It passed the Springs; but Jimmy stayed there still.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Over the pointed hill-top came the light</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Out of the mists on Ercall came the sun,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Red like a huntsman halloing after night,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Blowing a horn to rouse up everyone;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Through many glittering cities he had run,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Splashing the wind vanes on the dewy roofs</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>With golden sparks struck by his horses' hoofs.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>The watchman rose, rubbing his rusty eyes,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He stirred the pot of cocoa for his mate;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The fireman watched his head of power rise.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'What time?' he asked.  'You haven't long to wait.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'Now, is it time?'  'Yes.  Let her ripple.'  Straight</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The whistle shrieked its message, 'Up to work!</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Up, or be fined a quarter if you shirk.'</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="left line"><span>Hearing the whistle, Jimmy raised his head,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'The warning call, and me in Sunday clo'es;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I'd better go; I've time.  The sun looks red,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>I feel so stiff' I'm very nearly froze.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>So over brook and through the fields he goes,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>'Young Jimmy Gurney's been upon the tiles.'</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>The second whistle blew and work began,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>He tripped and stumbled like a drunken man;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He muddled all, whatever he was bid,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The foreman cursed, 'Good God, what ails the kid?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Hi!  Gurney.  You.  We'll have you crocking soon,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>You take a lie down till the afternoon.'</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Or would do if a man could, but how could I</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Then you come nagging round and never cease?</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Well, take the job and give me my release,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Cider and beer for thirsty workers' slaking,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>He called for liquor at 'The Bull and Boar';</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Moody he drank; the woman asked him why:</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>His Binger-Bopper song, but cut it short.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>His wits were working like a brewer's wort</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>A poor old woman pitted against death,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Bringing her pennyworth of love for bail.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Wisdom, beauty, and love may not avail.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>She was too late.  'Yes, he was here; oh, yes.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>The speaker tested both his trouser straps</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>For forty yards away, beyond the bridge,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Jimmy still drank, the devil still sowed seed.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>'A bit in bed,' she thought, 'is what I need.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>The bridge-stone shining, full of silver specks,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>A Stoke Saint Michael carter cracked his whip,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>He found old Callow's plough-bat, which he took,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Four newly-tired cartwheels hung to cool.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>He had loved the place when under Anna's rule.</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Then stillness, while a little cloud went drift.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The weight upon his thigh bones wouldn't lift;</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Then poultry in a long procession came,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Offering her lips with grains for them to eat.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>The redbreasts come with little wiry feet,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>The same might come to any one of us.'</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>They brought him bits of cake at tea time: thus</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>Works in the marvellous hearts of simple men.</span></div>

<div class="line-block outermost">

<div class="left line"><span>Of how the game went at the football play,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And how the rooks outside had started mating.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>And all the time they knew the rope was waiting,</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>The elm-tree rooks were cawing at the springing:</span></div>

<div class="left line"><span>A rest for broken things too broke to mend.</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>O Captain Christ, our blessed Lord and Friend,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>We are two wandered sinners in the mire,</span></div>
<div class="left line"><span>Burn our dead hearts with love out of Thy fire.</span></div>

<p class="pnext"><span>"Mr Masefield is to be congratulated on a remarkable achievement--a
vital portrait of a man, the drama of a great spiritual conquest, and many
passages of high beauty."--</span><em class="italics">Spectator</em><span>.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This is probably the most important addition to English religious
poetry since Francis Thompson wrote 'The Hound of Heaven.'  'The
Everlasting Mercy' is the story
of a conversion; not the 'interesting'
conversion of some cultured and introspective Agnostic, full of wise saws
and modern instances, but the sensational, primitive, catastrophic
conversion of a village wastrel, violent alike in body, mind and soul--a
drunkard, poacher, bully and libertine....  In it Mr Masefield has
accomplished two separate things.  He has written a superb poem, swift
in its pace and vivid in its phrasing, and produced as well a psychological
document of surpassing interest....  He has brought the flaming torch of
beauty to light the dry processes of the religious psychologist."--EVELYN
UNDERHILL in </span><em class="italics">The Daily News</em><span>.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Here, beyond question, in 'The Everlasting Mercy,' is a great poem,
as true to the essentials of its ancient art as it is astoundingly modern
in its method; a poem, too, which 'every clergyman in the country ought
to read as a revelation of the heathenism still left in the land.' ... Its
technical force is on a level with its high, inspiring thought.  It makes
the reader think; it goads him to emotion; and it leaves him alive with
a fresh appreciation of the wonderful capacity of human nature to receive
new influences and atone for old and apparently ineradicable
wrongs."--ARTHUR WAUGH in </span><em class="italics">The Daily Chronicle</em><span>.</span></p>

<br />Second Impression</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Fine, nervous, dramatic English.  Words which eat into
the soul, which have a meaning, which are revelatory of
character.  A fine virility about the whole play and its
conception.  An altogether admirable piece of writing which fully
justifies Mr Masefield's real literary distinction."--</span><em class="italics">Observer</em><span>.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In this Roman tragedy, while we admire its closely knit
structure, dramatic effectiveness, and atmosphere of reality
... the warmth and colour of the diction are the most notable
things....  He knows the art of phrasing; he has the instinct
for and by them."--</span><em class="italics">Athenaeum</em><span>.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The talk of Pompey, of Domitius, of Acilius, is not that of
great lords, but rather of men like Hawkins and Drake.  This
is the result of Mr Masefield's imaginative handling.  He sees
them so, and so they live.  They live indeed.  Their characters
are clear and bold; they say nothing but what reveals them
and helps to make the tragedy a rich as well as a moving
thing.  It is poetry.  It is almost music, and on the first few
pages there are notes that linger with us to the end, haunting
us like the blowing of horns in an old and silent
forest."--Mr EDWARD THOMAS in </span><em class="italics">The Daily Chronicle</em><span>.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He has written a great tragedy....  The dialogue is
written in strong, simple, and nervous prose, flashing with

<h4 class="level-4 pfirst section-title title"><span>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h4>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

<h4 class="level-4 pfirst section-title title"><span>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.</span></h4>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Corrected </span><em class="italics">editions</em><span> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is
renamed. </span><em class="italics">Versions</em><span> based on separate sources are treated as new
eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
